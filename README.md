### Azure AI Language

[Text-based summarization powered by fine-tuned large-language model](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/introducing-new-task-optimized-summarization-capabilities-powered-by-fine-tuned-/3983822)

Using z-Code++, GPT-3.5 Turbo (status Nov-2023)

**Azure AI Language Service** provides various **Natural Language Processing (NLP) features**, powered by **task-optimized large language models (LLMs)**. Here’s a breakdown:

| **Feature**                      | **LLM Used** |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Transformer-based models |
| **Personal and Health Data Detection (PII)** | Transformer-based models |
| **Language Detection**           | Multilingual LLMs |
| **Sentiment Analysis & Opinion Mining** | Sentiment-optimized LLMs |

#### Z-Code++: A Pre-trained Language Model Optimized for Abstractive Summarization

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/z-code-a-pre-trained-language-model-optimized-for-abstractive-summarization/

This paper presents Z-Code++, a new pre-trained language model optimized for abstractive text summarization. The model extends the state of the art encoder-decoder model using three techniques. First, we use a two-phase pre-training process to improve model's performance on low-resource summarization tasks. The model is first pre-trained using text corpora for language understanding, and then is continually pre-trained on summarization corpora for grounded text generation. Second, we replace self-attention layers in the encoder with disentangled attention layers, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively. Third, we use fusion-in-encoder, a simple yet effective method of encoding long sequences in a hierarchical manner. Z-Code++ creates new state of the art on 9 out of 13 text summarization tasks across 5 languages. Our model is parameter-efficient in that it outperforms the 600x larger PaLM-540B on XSum, and the finetuned 200x larger GPT3-175B on SAMSum. In zero-shot and few-shot settings, our model substantially outperforms the competing models.

> Azure AI Foundry provides benchmarking tools to compare different LLMs, but direct comparisons with Azure AI Language Service are not explicitly listed in the model leaderboards. However, you can evaluate Azure AI Language Service using the same benchmarking framework by running tests on your own data.

### Azure AI Vision

Florence is designed for general-purpose image understanding tasks like classification, captioning, object detection, and visual question answering. It powers several Azure AI Vision capabilities, especially those involving multimodal understanding (combining text and image inputs).

[Project Florence](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/projectflorence/)

**Azure AI Vision** integrates various **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to enhance its capabilities across different vision-related tasks. Here’s a breakdown of the features and the LLMs used:

| **Feature**                     | **LLM Used** |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** | Deep-learning-based models for text extraction |
| **Image Analysis**               | Vision-language models for object detection and scene understanding |
| **Face Recognition**             | AI models optimized for facial detection and identity verification |
| **Video Retrieval**              | Multimodal LLMs for natural language-based video search |
| **Dense Captioning**             | Vision-language models for automatic image descriptions |
| **Spatial Analysis**             | AI models for movement tracking and environment analysis |

Azure AI Vision combines **computer vision** with **natural language processing** to improve accessibility, searchability, and automation in image and video analysis. Let me know if you need more details on any specific feature!
